## Introduction

It's 2024 and I've been working as a Software Developer in one capacity or the other since late 2019. I've also been involved in coding since 2017.

Sometime around 2020, I pivoted fully into web development picking up Javascript and PHP. There after, I picked up Laravel and have taken various tutorials in web development while building and working alongside.

Now, I haven't really been particular about certifications but very recently, I was listening to Scott Galloway's interview on a podcast and his comment on certifications really stuck with me. So, I've decided to accept the LinkedIn economy we live in and get certifications as a next step in my career.

## Learning Java

One technology I've always been interested in is Java. It was the first programming language I particularly interacted with when I picked up programming.

I was learning Android development then and Java was still the primary go-to language for Android development. That was before Google made it's pivot to Kotlin.

I've since moved on to using Javascript, a scripting language on both the frontend and backend of web development. I have however noticed that a particular calibre of companies are keen on using Java and other statically typed languages on the backend and this has proven to be some sort of challenge. So, I'll go ahead to challenge myself to learn Java, not randomly but using a guided course on Coursera.

Yeah, I recently subscribed to coursera at $49/month. That's quite an investment for me considering that I'm currently based in Nigeria where that's roughly NGN90,000/month. For context, the minimum wage in Nigeria at this point has just been recently increased to NGN70,000/month.

Most importantly, this is a challenge I want to give myself and part of a bigger picture and not necessarily as a pathway to assist Job-hunting.

I trust myself to see it through to the end.

By the way, the course is [Java FullStack Developer Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/java-fullstack) by Board Affinity.

I'll update this article as I go along. Cheers!
